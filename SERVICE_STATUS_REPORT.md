## Service Testing Results

### 1. Checkin Service (Port 8086)
**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8086/health
```
**Response:** ✅ Service healthy

**Create Check-in:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8086/api/v1/checkin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "employee_id": 123,
    "checkin_type": "checkin",
    "location": "Office-Main",
    "notes": "Regular check-in"
  }'
```
**Response:** ✅ Check-in recorded successfully

**Valid Check-in Types:**
- `checkin` - Employee checking in
- `checkout` - Employee checking out
- `break_start` - Starting break
- `break_end` - Ending break

### 2. Payment Service (Port 8087)
**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8087/health
```
**Response:** ✅ Service healthy

**Create Payment:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8087/api/v1/payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: tenant-123" \
  -d '{
    "order_id": "ORD-123",
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "amount": 100.50,
    "currency": "USD",
    "payment_method": "credit_card",
    "gateway": "stripe",
    "description": "Test payment"
  }'
```
**Status:** ⚠️ Database integration needs debugging (manual insert works)

**Supported Payment Methods:**
- `credit_card`
- `debit_card`
- `bank_transfer`
- `digital_wallet`
- `cash`

### 3. File Service (Port 8088)
**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8088/health
```
**Response:** ✅ Service healthy

**Upload File:**
```bash
curl -X POST -F "files=@/path/to/file.txt" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: e04d1d3f-45dd-4f16-aa31-ce98d467ed6f" \
  -H "X-User-ID: 4c8a2684-97d1-4a66-85ea-f9466ebf61d6" \
  http://localhost:8088/api/v1/files/upload
```
**Response:** ✅ File uploaded successfully

**List Files:**
```bash
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: e04d1d3f-45dd-4f16-aa31-ce98d467ed6f" \
  http://localhost:8088/api/v1/files
```
**Response:** ✅ Files listed successfully

## Database Migrations Completed

### 1. Checkin Service Database
- ✅ `checkin_records` table created
- ✅ Indexes and constraints applied
- ✅ Sample data inserted and tested

### 2. Payment Service Database
- ✅ `payments` table created with comprehensive structure
- ✅ Payment method and status validation constraints
- ✅ Proper indexing for performance
- ✅ Trigger for updated_at timestamps

### 3. File Service Database
- ✅ `files` table with metadata support
- ✅ `file_access_logs` for audit trail
- ✅ `file_permissions` for access control
- ✅ UUID-based primary keys and foreign keys

## API Gateway Integration
All new services are properly configured in the API Gateway with route proxying:
- ✅ `/api/checkin/*` → Checkin Service (8086)
- ✅ `/api/payment/*` → Payment Service (8087)  
- ✅ `/api/file/*` → File Service (8088)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Debug Payment Service** - POST requests failing (database connectivity issue)
2. **Add Authentication** - Integrate with Auth Service for protected endpoints
3. **Error Logging** - Enhanced error logging and monitoring
4. **Input Validation** - Strengthen request validation and error handling

### Future Enhancements:
1. **File Service Features:**
   - File versioning system
   - Thumbnail generation for images
   - Virus scanning integration
   - Cloud storage integration (S3/MinIO)

2. **Payment Service Features:**
   - Webhook support for payment gateways
   - Payment scheduling and recurring payments
   - Refund and dispute management
   - Payment analytics dashboard

3. **Checkin Service Features:**
   - Geolocation validation
   - Photo capture and verification
   - Integration with HRM system
   - Attendance reporting and analytics

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - JWT token validation
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration
   - Input sanitization

5. **Monitoring and Observability:**
   - Health checks integration
   - Metrics collection (Prometheus)
   - Logging aggregation (ELK stack)
   - Distributed tracing (Jaeger)

## Development Commands

### Start All Services:
```bash
# Database and infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Start services in separate terminals
cd apps/backend/checkin-service && go run cmd/main.go
cd apps/backend/payment-service && go run cmd/main.go  
cd apps/backend/file-service && go run cmd/main_simple.go
```

### Test All Health Endpoints:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8086/health  # Checkin Service
curl http://localhost:8087/health  # Payment Service
curl http://localhost:8088/health  # File Service
```

## Architecture Notes

### Multi-Tenant Architecture:
- All services support tenant isolation via `X-Tenant-ID` header
- Database level tenant separation implemented
- UUID-based tenant identification for security

### Database Design:
- PostgreSQL for relational data (payments, checkins, files)
- UUID primary keys for security and scalability
- Proper indexing for performance
- Soft delete patterns implemented
- Audit trails with created_at/updated_at timestamps

### Service Communication:
- HTTP REST APIs for synchronous communication
- Standardized error response formats
- Consistent health check endpoints
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Database Connection Failed:** Check postgres password is `postgres123`
2. **UUID Invalid:** Ensure tenant/user IDs are proper UUIDs
3. **Port Already in Use:** Use `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill -9` to free ports
4. **File Upload Fails:** Check upload directory permissions and UUID headers

### Service Logs:
Monitor service logs for detailed error information and debugging.
