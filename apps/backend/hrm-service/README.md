## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```
HRM_SERVICE_PORT=8083
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/zplus_saas
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

### Database
The service uses PostgreSQL with the following tables:
- `departments` - Department information
- `employees` - Employee records
- `leaves` - Leave requests and approvals
- `performance_reviews` - Performance evaluation records

## Multi-tenant Support

All data is isolated by `tenant_id`:
- Every database operation includes tenant filtering
- Tenant ID is extracted from the request headers via middleware
- Cross-tenant data access is prevented at the database level

## Authentication & Authorization

- Uses JWT-based authentication via API Gateway
- Tenant middleware extracts tenant information from tokens
- All endpoints require valid authentication
- Role-based access control can be implemented at the handler level

## Error Handling

Standard HTTP status codes:
- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error

Error response format:
```json
{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

## Health Check

```
GET /health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "hrm-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "time": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Pagination for list endpoints (default: 10 items per page, max: 100)
- Soft deletes for data integrity
- Optimized queries with JOINs where needed
- Connection pooling for database connections

## Business Rules

### Leave Management
- Leave requests cannot be made for past dates
- Weekend days are excluded from leave day calculations
- Leave balance is calculated based on entitlements and used days
- Only pending leaves can be updated or deleted
- Leave approval requires manager or HR role

### Performance Reviews
- Rating scale is 1-5 (with decimals)
- Reviews follow workflow: draft ‚Üí submitted ‚Üí completed
- Only draft reviews can be deleted
- Performance statistics exclude draft reviews

### Employee Management
- Employee codes must be unique per tenant
- Email addresses must be unique per tenant
- Manager must be an existing active employee
- Employee status changes are tracked with timestamps

## Development

### Running Locally
```bash
# Set environment variables
export HRM_SERVICE_PORT=8083
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/zplus_saas

# Run the service
go run apps/backend/hrm-service/cmd/main.go
```

### Running with Docker
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t hrm-service -f apps/backend/hrm-service/Dockerfile .

# Run container
docker run -p 8083:8083 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host.docker.internal:5432/zplus_saas \
  hrm-service
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
go test ./apps/backend/hrm-service/...

# Test health check
curl http://localhost:8083/health
```

## Integration

### API Gateway Integration
Add route configuration to API Gateway:
```go
// In api-gateway routes
app.All("/hrm/*", handlers.ProxyToHRM)
```

### Frontend Integration
Use the service endpoints with proper authentication headers:
```javascript
// Example: Get employees
const response = await fetch('/api/hrm/v1/employees', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'X-Tenant-ID': tenantId
  }
});
```

## Monitoring & Logging

- Structured logging with log levels
- Request/response logging via middleware
- Performance metrics tracking
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting

## Security

- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS protection through proper response headers
- Rate limiting (implemented at API Gateway level)
- Tenant isolation at database level
